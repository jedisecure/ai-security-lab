## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 🚨 For Security Issues

**DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, please:

1. **Email us directly** at [testpromptinjection@gmail.com] with:
   - A detailed description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Potential impact assessment
   - Any suggested fixes (if available)

2. **Response Timeline**:
   - We'll acknowledge receipt within 24 hours
   - Initial assessment within 72 hours
   - Regular updates every 5 business days
   - Target resolution within 30 days

3. **Responsible Disclosure**:
   - Please allow us time to fix the issue before public disclosure
   - We'll work with you on an appropriate disclosure timeline
   - Credit will be given for responsible disclosure

### 🛡️ Security Considerations

This application is designed for **educational purposes only**. However, we maintain security best practices:

#### What We Protect Against
- API key exposure and misuse
- Code injection vulnerabilities
- Cross-site scripting (XSS)
- SQL injection attacks
- Session hijacking
- CSRF attacks

#### Built-in Security Features
- Environment-based secret management
- Input validation and sanitization
- Secure session handling
- Rate limiting (planned)
- Content Security Policy headers (planned)

#### Educational Safety
- All injection examples are safe and controlled
- No real sensitive data is processed
- Demo responses when API is unavailable
- Clear disclaimers about educational use

### 🔍 Security Scope

#### In Scope
- Authentication and authorization issues
- Data validation and injection vulnerabilities
- Session management problems
- API security issues
- Secret management vulnerabilities
- Client-side security issues (XSS, etc.)

#### Out of Scope
- Issues requiring physical access to servers
- Social engineering attacks against project maintainers
- Issues in third-party dependencies (unless we can reasonably fix them)
- Rate limiting or DDoS protection (unless causing data breach)

### 🧪 Security Testing

We encourage security testing but please:

1. **Responsible Testing**:
   - Test only against your own instances
   - Don't target our demo/production instances without permission
   - Respect rate limits and don't overload services

2. **Permitted Testing**:
   - Static code analysis
   - Dependency vulnerability scanning
   - Local security testing
   - Automated security tools

3. **Not Permitted**:
   - Testing against live production instances
   - Social engineering of maintainers
   - Physical attacks or attempts to access infrastructure
   - Denial of service attacks

### 📋 Security Checklist for Contributors

Before submitting code, please ensure:

- [ ] No hardcoded secrets or API keys
- [ ] Input validation for all user inputs
- [ ] Proper error handling (no sensitive info in errors)
- [ ] Secure session management
- [ ] SQL queries are parameterized
- [ ] File uploads are validated and secured
- [ ] Third-party libraries are up to date

### 🔧 Security Configuration

#### Environment Variables
Always use environment variables for sensitive configuration:

```bash
# Required for production
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key
SESSION_SECRET=random-secret-key

# Optional security settings
FLASK_ENV=production
FORCE_HTTPS=true
```

#### Production Deployment
For production deployments:

1. Use HTTPS only
2. Set secure session cookies
3. Implement rate limiting
4. Regular security updates
5. Monitor for unusual activity
