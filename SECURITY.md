Reporting a Vulnerability
We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

🚨 For Security Issues
DO NOT create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, please:

Email us directly at [security@example.com] with:

A detailed description of the vulnerability
Steps to reproduce the issue
Potential impact assessment
Any suggested fixes (if available)
Response Timeline:

We'll acknowledge receipt within 24 hours
Initial assessment within 72 hours
Regular updates every 7 days until resolved
What to expect:

We'll work with you to understand and validate the issue
We'll develop and test a fix
We'll coordinate the disclosure timeline
We'll credit you in our security advisory (if desired)
🛡️ Current Security Measures
Frontend Security (Version 1.2+)
XSS Prevention: All innerHTML replaced with safe DOM manipulation
Input Validation: Comprehensive client-side validation with length limits
CSRF Protection: Token-based protection for all API requests
Rate Limiting: 1-second throttle between requests to prevent abuse
Secure Error Handling: No sensitive data exposed in error messages
Input Protection
All user inputs are validated and sanitized on both client and server
Multi-layer XSS protection through safe content rendering
SQL injection prevention (when database features are added)
API response validation to prevent malformed data processing
Data Security
Secure API key management through environment variables
Session security with configurable secret keys
No sensitive data storage in logs
Secure communication protocols
URL encoding for all dynamic API endpoints
Educational Safety
All injection examples are safe and controlled
No real sensitive data is processed
Demo responses when API is unavailable
Clear disclaimers about educational use
🔍 Security Scope
In Scope
Authentication and authorization issues
Data validation and injection vulnerabilities
Session management problems
API security issues
Secret management vulnerabilities
Client-side security issues (XSS, etc.)
Out of Scope
Issues requiring physical access to servers
Social engineering attacks against project maintainers
Issues in third-party dependencies (unless we can reasonably fix them)
Rate limiting or DDoS protection (unless causing data breach)
🧪 Security Testing
We encourage security testing but please:

Responsible Testing:

Test only against your own instances
Don't target our demo/production instances without permission
Respect rate limits and don't overload services
Permitted Testing:

Static code analysis
Dependency vulnerability scanning
Local security testing
Automated security tools
Not Permitted:

Testing against live production instances
Social engineering of maintainers
Physical attacks or attempts to access infrastructure
