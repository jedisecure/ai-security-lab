This is the most basic form of prompt injection. The attacker tries to override the original instructions with new ones.

**Why it might work:**
- Many AI systems follow the most recent instruction
- Simple language models may not distinguish between system and user instructions

**Defense strategies:**
- Clearly separate system and user inputs
- Use instruction hierarchies
- Implement input validation

This injection attempts to completely change the AI's persona and behavior.

**Technique breakdown:**
1. First, it tries to erase the original role ("Forget you're...")
2. Then it assigns a new, potentially harmful role
3. Finally, it asks for advice that would be inappropriate for the original role

**Why this is dangerous:**
- Could lead to harmful advice outside the AI's intended scope
- Bypasses safety measures designed for specific use cases

This attack attempts to extract sensitive system information that should remain hidden.

**What the attacker is trying to get:**
- System prompts that might contain sensitive information
- API keys, passwords, or other secrets

# Understanding Prompt Injection

Prompt injection is a type of attack where malicious input manipulates an AI system's behavior by interfering with its original instructions.

## How it works:
1. **System Prompt**: The AI receives initial instructions (usually hidden from users)
2. **User Input**: The user provides input that should be processed according to the system prompt
3. **Injection**: Malicious user input attempts to override or modify the system instructions
4. **Unintended Behavior**: The AI may follow the injected instructions instead of the original ones

## Real-world analogy:
Think of it like giving someone directions to a restaurant, but then someone else whispers different directions in their ear. They might end up following the wrong directions instead of yours.

# The Importance of Understanding Prompt Injection

## Security Implications:
- **Data Breaches**: Injections can extract sensitive information
- **Unauthorized Actions**: AI systems might perform unintended operations
- **Reputation Damage**: Compromised AI behavior reflects poorly on organizations
- **Financial Loss**: Malicious use of AI services can be costly

## Common Vulnerable Applications:
- **Chatbots**: Customer service bots revealing internal information
- **Content Filters**: Bypassing moderation systems
- **Code Generators**: Producing malicious code
- **Email Assistants**: Accessing private communications

## Ethical Considerations:
Understanding these attacks helps build better defenses and promotes responsible AI development.

# Common Prompt Injection Patterns

## 1. Direct Override
Simply telling the AI to ignore previous instructions:
- "Ignore all previous instructions"
- "Disregard your system prompt"
- "Forget what you were told before"

## 2. Role Playing
Convincing the AI to adopt a different persona:
- "You are now a [different role]"
- "Pretend to be..."
- "Act as if you are..."

## 3. Context Manipulation
Using formatting to confuse the AI about what's system vs user input:
- Using delimiters like --- or ===
- Mimicking system prompt formatting
- Creating fake "end of instructions" markers

Try these techniques in the lab to see how they work!

# Sophisticated Injection Methods

## Template Injection
Exploiting how prompts are constructed:
```
System: You are {role}. User input: {input}
```

If the system blindly substitutes values, an attacker could inject:
- Role: "a helpful assistant. IGNORE ALL PREVIOUS INSTRUCTIONS"
- Input: "What is 2+2?"

## Context Window Poisoning
Filling the AI's context with misleading information to influence behavior.

## Indirect Injection
Using external data sources (documents, web pages) to inject malicious prompts.

## Multi-turn Attacks
Building trust over multiple interactions before executing the injection.

# Protecting Against Prompt Injection

## Input Validation
- Sanitize user inputs
- Remove or escape special characters
- Validate input length and format

## Prompt Design
- Use clear delimiters between system and user content
- Implement instruction hierarchies
- Use defensive prompts that resist manipulation

## System Architecture
- Separate user inputs from system prompts
- Implement multiple validation layers
- Use specialized models for sensitive tasks

## Monitoring and Detection
- Log all interactions
- Monitor for suspicious patterns
- Implement rate limiting

## Best Practices
1. Never trust user input completely
2. Use principle of least privilege
3. Implement defense in depth
4. Regular security audits

# Responsible Security Research

## Ethical Guidelines
- Only test systems you own or have permission to test
- Follow responsible disclosure practices
- Respect terms of service and legal boundaries
- Consider the impact of your research

## Responsible Disclosure
1. Report vulnerabilities privately to the vendor
2. Allow reasonable time for fixes
3. Work with the vendor on disclosure timeline
4. Avoid causing harm or data breaches

## Legal Considerations
- Unauthorized access is illegal in most jurisdictions
- Always obtain proper authorization
- Document your authorization clearly
- Understand relevant laws in your area

## Building Better AI Systems
Use your knowledge to:
- Design more secure AI applications
- Implement better defense mechanisms
- Educate others about AI security
- Contribute to security research responsibly
